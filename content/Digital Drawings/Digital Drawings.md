I’ve always wanted to tell a story, but I struggled to find the right medium. I considered writing a novel, but I found it difficult to paint a picture using only words. I thought about a WebToon, but without a drawing tablet, I felt stuck—so I almost gave up on the dream entirely.

Everything changed when I discovered about a game called ***[missed messages.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/812810/missed_messages/)*** through [itch](https://itch.io). It hit me: I could create something like that using just pencil and paper. I researched the process and realized I could sketch by hand and paint my work using Krita.
