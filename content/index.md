Hi, I’m **[[Ishi]]**. Welcome to my creative portfolio! I’m just beginning my journey as an artist, and my main focus right now is developing my very first Visual Novel. I have plenty of projects in the works for 2026:

- **Art:** Follow my progress through [[Traditional Drawings]], [[Digital Art]], and [[Visual Novel Concepts]].
    
- **Entertainment**: Explore my curated logs for [[Anime]], [[TV Shows]], and [[Books]] to see everything I have watched and read.
    
- **The Playlist:** I'm currently building a cute, dedicated site to showcase my Gaming & Music Libraries—stay tuned for the link!

I’m learning and creating something new every day. Wish me luck!
